// This is a simple example to test communication with the motors
// It should make all motor led blink once per second
// Make sure to select the correct type of interface (hardware or serial, with or without tristate buffer)
// and baudrate depending of your configuration.
// Default baudrate is 1000000 (only hardware serial is capable of that speed)
